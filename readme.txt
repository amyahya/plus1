twentyten +1

This is a child theme to enable owner of wordpress site with twentyten theme to create Facebook Page with ease. 

This is still on development process, don't use it on your live site. If u're wordpress wizard, php ninjas, or other superhero i'm welcoming any suggestion :)

I'm just a php newbie so the code might be messy or full of holes. I just cooked it up from alot of source and tutorials.

If u're feeling adventurous or curious here's the step :

- Install like u're installing wp-theme. Make sure u got the needed parent theme twentyten ( currently wp's default ). Then activate it. ( currently i'm using wp 3.1 , so i don't know how it'll behave on 3.0 or below )

- After that u'll see there's new post type called "Facebook Pages" ( on the sidebar). Here you could create your pages content.

- Create your page contents by creating new page on "Facebook Pages" on your wordpress.


- If you haven't had Fb Page, & Fb App for it, create it. Check out this tutorial if u don't know what i mean : http://www.hyperarts.com/blog/adding-iframe-application-to-facebook-fan-page/

- Take not on your Fb App Credentials (app id, app secret, api key ). And fill it on the appropriate field on your page.


- good luck -

ps.
- sample fb page : http://www.facebook.com/pages/1/202918663053267
- fan gating and the red notification is hard coded on the template.
